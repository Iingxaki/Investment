# Sentiment Scrapper for Investment
An idea borne to have a program running in the background paired with pinescript or another code for MTL5 where we can automate bots for trading. The program would be coded to monitor different news sources or economic calendars (would need API for this) and then have a natural language processor to process the different titles or content that it monitors to extract a score of whether a specific currency is being seen positively or not. This is operating under the hypothesis that news sites would create little ripples that's reflected in the forex market. Can be applied to any market but I am using forex due to its direct connection to economic calendar.
